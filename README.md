# EarthTrek
EarthTrek is an interactive 3D web application. It´s easy access for all kinds of users encourages the use of data that NASA`S EOS program compiles and collect with satellites´s instruments.

Our app allows to:
* Observing satellite images
* View real-time orbits of the various satellites around Earth from launch to future predictions.
* View satellites´s models on 3D.
* Learn the instruments that each satellite owns.
* Get to know the mission of NASA's Earth Observing System program.
* Display a comparison of the same geographic location on two different dates on which the satellite instruments have been collecting information, being able to appreciate the changes over time and being able to vary the selection of amount of data displayed at the same time.
* View satellites that are no longer active.
* Predict the route of the ISS (International Space Station), when it will be passing through an specific area and its trajectory.

It allows to visualize in real time the orbits of the different kinds of satellites around the Earth up to its launch until future predictions.

With this tool, we aim to encourage new generations to get involved in NASA's programs, from spreading the word to becoming active members -or even pioneers- of present and future developments.

Public engagement is key in the pursuit of aerospace exploration.
