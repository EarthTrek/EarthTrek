EarthTrek is an interactive 3D web application. It´s easy access for all kinds of users encourages the use of data that NASA`S EOS program compiles and collect with satellites´s instruments.

* Observing satellite images
* View real-time orbits of the various satellites around Earth from launch to future predictions.
* View satellites´s models on 3D.
* Learn the instruments that each satellite owns.
* Get to know the mission of NASA'S Earth Observating System program.
* Display a comparison of the same geographic location on two different dates on which the satellite instruments have been collecting information, being able to appreciate the changes over time and being able to vary the selection of amount of data displayed at the same time.
